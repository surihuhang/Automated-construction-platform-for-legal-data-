  "source_text": "Appellate Division of the High Court — Civil Appeal No 13 of 2021\n\nBelinda Ang Saw Ean JAD, See Kee Oon J, Chua Lee Ming J\n\n23 July 2021\n23 July 2021\nBelinda Ang Saw Ean JAD (delivering the judgment of the court ex tempore):\n1 This appeal concerns the rightful ownership of 122 gold bars. The gold bars were purchased in 1989 from United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) in Singapore. At the time of purchase, the gold bars were held under six UOB Gold Certificates bearing various serial numbers and dated 11 February 1989 (the “Original Gold Certificates”). The Original Gold Certificates were issued in the joint names of the appellant, Mr Soemarto Sulistio (the “appellant”), and his wife (“Mdm Soemiati”). On 17 April 2016, the appellant, at Mdm Soemiati’s request, signed the Original Gold Certificates under the section with the heading “Delivery Instructions”. With the signed “Delivery Instructions”, Mdm Soemiati obtained new gold certificates in her sole name in May 2016. The Original Gold Certificates were thus cancelled. Mdm Soemiati died in April 2017, and her will bequeathed the gold bars to the respondents, who are the first, second, fourth and fifth children of the appellant and Mdm Soemiati. In HC/S 836/2019, the appellant essentially sued the respondents for the return of the gold bars claiming a beneficial interest in the same under the new gold certificates.\n2 The trial judge (the “Judge”) dismissed the appellant’s claim. The Judge’s decision is reported in Soemarto Sulistio v Stukan Yetty Fang and others [2021] SGHC 04 (the “Judgment”). The Judge applied Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun [2014] 3 SLR 1048 at [160] (“Chan Yuen Lan framework”) and held that, although the couple’s common intention in 1989 was for the gold bars to be held jointly, the couple’s subsequent common intention in 2016 was to transfer both legal and beneficial ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati.\n3 The case that was argued before the Judge focused on the intention of the couple in and after April 2016. The shape of the appellant’s argument was that the gold bars were held in Mdm Soemiati’s name and remained in her custody under a common intention constructive trust. Specifically, the appellant did not contest the validity of the transfer of the appellant’s legal title to Mdm Soemiati. By the terms of his Declaration of 22 December 2017 (“2017 Declaration”), the appellant accepted that he had transferred the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati who held the same on trust for his benefit. Both parties approached the case on the basis that the dispute should be resolved by applying the Chan Yuen Lan framework as the Judge noted (Judgment at [17] to [23]). Consequently, the Judge approached her decision using the Chan Yuen Lan framework (see Judgment at [24] to [27]).\n4 Dr Tang Hang Wu (“Dr Tang”), instructed to argue the appeal for the appellant, submits that the Judge was wrong to have found that the subsequent common intention of the parties in 2016 had been to transfer both beneficial and legal ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati. The correct inquiry is whether the appellant had intended to make an inter vivos gift to the wife. Counsel for the respondents, Mr Jimmy Yim SC (“Mr Yim”) submits that the Judge was not wrong to apply the Chan Yuen Lan framework, but Mr Yim accepts that the dispositive issue is whether the appellant intended to make an inter vivos gift of the gold bars, and relies on the presumption of advancement in the wife’s favour. Mr Yim further argues that the burden of proof is on the appellant to establish that he had intended to maintain a joint beneficial interest in the gold bars under the new gold certificates with a right of survivorship despite his signing of the Original Gold Certificates as described above.\n5 We accept that an important factual question is whether the appellant intended to gift legal and beneficial ownership of the gold bars to his wife solely when he signed the Original Gold Certificates in 2016. We also accept that the dispute need not have been resolved by applying the Chan Yuen Lan framework, as the transfer of the gold bars in 2016 concerned an inter vivos gift and it had nothing to do with the parties’ financial contributions. Notwithstanding the approach adopted by the Judge, the factual finding at [52] of her Judgment that the appellant intended such a gift is not affected and, in our view, it should not be disturbed, as the finding is not plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. We will elaborate on this.\n6 The appellant pleaded at para 42(2) of his statement of claim (amendment no. 2) (“SOC”) that he “did not intend to give the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati during his life time”. However, the appellant also pleaded in his SOC, and further particularised in his further and better particulars, that Mdm Soemiati held the gold bars “on trust” – specifically, either a resulting trust, Quistclose trust, or constructive trust – “for the [appellant] and/or Mdm Soemiati jointly and/or for their benefit”. This was noted by the Judge in her Judgment at [14]. The reliefs sought in the appellant’s SOC, which remain unamended in this appeal, are, inter alia, (a) a declaration that he is the beneficial owner of all the gold bars and (b) a declaration that the estate of Mdm Soemiati is holding the gold bars on trust and for the benefit of the appellant. By his pleaded case, therefore, the appellant accepts the existence of the trust and hence sought the aforementioned declaratory reliefs. As mentioned, the appellant’s 2017 Declaration also maintained that Mdm Soemiati held the gold bars on trust for him (see Judgment at [44]).\n7 It follows from the foregoing that the appellant accepted the fact that the legal title to the gold bars was validly transferred to Mdm Soemiati at the time the appellant signed the Original Gold Certificates. Indeed, as the Judge noted in her Judgment at [48], the appellant accepted the validity of the transfer. The issue below was whether the appellant intended to pass beneficial ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati.\n8 However, on appeal, Dr Tang has raised a new argument that the precise subject matter of the gift was not effectively delivered because the Original Gold Certificates were signed by the appellant with the name of the transferee left blank. Dr Tang submits that this means that the gift is “incomplete”.\n9 This submission is fundamentally inconsistent with the appellant’s own pleaded case outlined at [6] above, as it seeks to challenge the validity of the transfer of legal title. We agree with the respondents that the appellant is running a different factual case on appeal for which he has not sought leave to do. This new case is also inconsistent with the appellant’s SOC, which he has also not sought to amend. The appellant is not permitted to advance this new point on appeal.\n10 We now turn to the question whether a valid inter vivos gift was made. A valid inter vivos gift is made where there is a subjective intention to gift and delivery of the precise subject matter of the gift: Toh Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina and another appeal [2021] 1 SLR 1176 at [52]. We have already explained that the latter requirement – the delivery of the precise subject matter of the gift – was not challenged at the trial below, and the appellant cannot resile from the position taken below. Consequently, the only remaining question is whether the appellant intended to gift beneficial ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati.\n11 The appellant’s main submission on appeal is that he did not intend to gift the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati in 2016 and, as stated in the appellant’s case at para 5, “there is no change in the joint beneficial ownership of the gold bars certificates with the right of survivorship” such that, “[u]pon the demise of Mdm Soemiati, he became the sole beneficial owner of the original certificates” [emphasis added]. Since it is the appellant’s case that there was no inter vivos gift of the gold bars to his wife, it is uncontroversial that the burden is on the appellant to prove this. We agree with the respondents and the Judge that the appellant has been unable to provide any credible, clear, or coherent explanation for why he signed the “Delivery Instructions” section of the Original Gold Certificates to transfer his interest.\n12 As the Judge rightly pointed out (see Judgment at [49(a)]), if the appellant’s intention was to retain full beneficial interest in the gold bars, including the right to survivorship, then his transfer of his joint legal title to his wife in 2016 would be completely inexplicable, as the appellant already had joint title to the gold bars prior to the transfer in April 2016. Thus, the appellant’s claim in this regard is inherently unbelievable.\n13 The appellant further submits that he signed on the “Delivery Instructions” section of the Original Gold Certificates so that Mdm Soemiati could have “control” over the certificates. This explanation makes no sense because Mdm Soemiati was always in possession of the certificates.\n14 Mr Yim relies on the presumption of advancement to rebut the resulting trust pleaded by the appellant, as this is a transfer of property from a husband to his wife, and the burden is on the appellant to prove that he had no intention to gift (see Koh Lian Chye and another v Koh Ah Leng and another and another appeal [2021] SGCA 69 (“Koh Lian Chye”) at [25]). We agree with Mr Yim that the appellant’s various explanations are inconsistent at best and not only fail to rebut the presumption of advancement but also point towards the appellant’s intention to gift.\n(a) In the appellant’s first affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), the appellant claimed that he had signed to ensure that the gold bars would go to his late wife after his death (“first AEIC explanation”). However, in the appellant’s supplementary AEIC, the appellant attested that he signed simply because his wife asked him to (“supplementary AEIC explanation”). Then, at the trial, the appellant testified that “I signed to prove the gold was mine” (“trial explanation”). These inconsistent explanations undermined his credibility as a witness.\n(b) The Judge found that the first AEIC explanation made little sense because the appellant himself admitted that he knew that the gold bars, being in joint names, would become solely owned by Mdm Soemiati should the appellant predecease her. The Judge’s finding is not plainly wrong.\n(c) As for the supplementary AEIC explanation, the Judge found it difficult to believe that an experienced businessman like the appellant would sign the Original Gold Certificates without question. The appellant’s explanation also did not sit well with his evidence that he was “surprised” when his wife asked him to sign, as it was not often that she would ask him to sign documents. This finding is also not plainly wrong. While the appellant submits that he did not ask Mdm Soemiati the reason for seeking his signature because he trusted her, this testimony is also dubious because of his earlier excuses.\n(d) As for the appellant’s trial explanation that he “signed to prove the gold was [his]” (see [14(a)] above), we agree with the respondents that the explanation makes no sense because he had signed under the very section of the Original Gold Certificates that had to do with the transfer of title to the gold bars. The appellant also failed to explain why there was a sudden need to sign the certificates to prove that the gold bars were his.\n(e) In his appellant’s case, the appellant now argues on appeal that another “possible rationale” why he had signed was because Mdm Soemiati’s name on the original gold certificates was slightly different from the name in her passport. This new argument is not even the appellant’s own testimony. Furthermore, this argument also does not make sense. If this claim were true, then the appellant would have known that Mdm Soemiati would need to go to UOB to effect the change in name. However, it was also the appellant’s evidence that he did not know that Mdm Soemiati did so (see Judgment at [53]).\n15 Dr Tang also submitted at the hearing before us that, even if the validity of the transfer of legal title cannot be challenged on appeal, the gift that was made was “conditional” on Mdm Soemiati holding the gold bars on trust for him. We reject this submission because, as Mr Yim points out, there is no evidence that the appellant had qualified his gift or signing of the gold bar certificates in any way. There is thus no basis to support an inference that the appellant had made such a “conditional” gift.\n16 Even though the name of the transferee was left blank on the Original Gold Certificates, the appellant not only signed but also dated the transfer. This supports the inference that he intended to transfer title there and then. Coupled with the fact that the signature had been requested by Mdm Soemiati, and that the appellant handed the signed certificates back to Mdm Soemiati herself, we find no basis to disturb the Judge’s inference that the appellant intended to gift the gold bars to his wife.\n17 The appellant also submits that the Judge had erroneously found that there was an agreement that the appellant would transfer the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati in exchange for Mdm Soemiati signing a Power of Attorney (“POA”) appointing their oldest son and third oldest child, Rudy Sulistio (also the third defendant at the trial), to transact the sale of Indonesian land jointly owned by the couple (“POA agreement”) (see Judgment at [34] to [40]). The appellant submits that this point was not pleaded by the respondents. That may be so but we agree with Mr Yim that the finding of the Judge on that aspect was not a material aspect of her Judgment and did not affect the Judge’s finding in relation to the appellant’s inability to provide a credible and coherent explanation for why he signed the Original Gold Certificates (see Judgment at [45] to [50] and [52]). For the same reason, Dr Tang’s attempt to challenge the POA agreement as supported by the evidence also does not take him far. We agree with the respondents that the evidence fully supports the Judge’s finding that the appellant intended to gift legal and beneficial ownership of the gold bars to Mdm Soemiati. There is no reason for us to disturb this finding. In any event, the Judge’s finding was broader than the POA agreement: the Judge found that there was an agreement between Mdm Soemiati and the appellant for her to be given the gold bars in exchange for the appellant to have sole access to the couple’s other properties (see, eg, Judgment at [36] and [39]).\n18 By way of observation, the appellant’s contention on beneficial ownership with right of survivorship is curious. On his submission, the right of survivorship would not have been relevant or necessary to the appellant’s analysis, since the appellant’s beneficial interest would have remained with him if the purported gift was invalid. However, the appellant also submits that his alleged beneficial interest in the gold bars arises from the fact that the right of survivorship continues to operate after the transfer in 2016 (see [11] above). While Dr Tang submits that, conceptually, there is no difficulty with the right of survivorship operating on the beneficial interest of Mdm Soemiati, the Court of Appeal has recently held that, in the case of a joint tenancy over property, the right of survivorship operates only on the legal interest and not the beneficial interest: see Koh Lian Chye at [24], endorsing Estate of Yang Chun (Mrs) née Sun Hui Min, deceased v Yang Chia-Yin [2019] 5 SLR 593 at [56]. Therefore, the beneficial interest in the gold bars cannot be held on trust for the appellant by way of survivorship after the transfer in 2016, since the appellant no longer retained legal title to the gold bars. Furthermore, if the appellant’s intention in 2016 was truly to retain the right of survivorship to the gold bars, there would have been even less reason for him to give up his joint legal title to the gold bars.\n19 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the appeal.

  "question": "### 问题背景\n\n2016年4月17日，申诉人苏马托·苏里斯提奥先生（“申诉人”）应其妻子苏米亚蒂女士（“苏米亚蒂女士”）的要求，在六份由新加坡大华银行（“UOB”）于1989年2月11日签发的、以其与妻子联名持有的金条证书（“原始金条证书”）上，于“交付指示”栏目处签名。签名时，“受让人”一栏为空白。随后，苏米亚蒂女士于2016年5月凭此获得了仅以其个人名义持有的新金条证书，原始证书被注销。苏米亚蒂女士于2017年4月去世，其遗嘱将涉案的122根金条遗赠给其与申诉人的四名子女（即本案被诉人）。申诉人于2019年提起诉讼，主张其对以苏米亚蒂女士个人名义持有的新证书下的金条享有实益权益，要求被诉人返还。\n\n在初审中，申诉人承认其已将金条的法律所有权有效转让给苏米亚蒂女士，但主张双方存在共同意图，即苏米亚蒂女士是以归复信托、Quistclose信托或推定信托的形式，为双方共同利益持有金条。申诉人特别强调，其签署行为并未改变双方对金条的“共同实益所有权及生存者取得权”。初审法官驳回了申诉人的主张，认定申诉人2016年的意图是将金条的**法律与实益所有权**一并赠与妻子。申诉人提起上诉，其代理律师在上诉中提出了新的论点，主张由于原始证书上“受让人”一栏为空白，该赠与的“特定标的物”并未有效交付，因此赠与“未完成”。此外，申诉人律师还主张，即使赠与成立，该赠与也是“附条件的”，即苏米亚蒂女士需为申诉人的利益以信托形式持有金条。\n\n本案涉及复杂的财产法、信托法与赠与法交叉问题，且申诉人在诉讼不同阶段的主张存在多处矛盾与变化。\n\n### 问题设计\n\n基于以上案情，请作为法律专家分析以下问题：\n\n1.  **法律定性分析**：申诉人主张其在2016年签署原始金条证书时，意图是维持与妻子的“共同实益所有权及生存者取得权”。请结合新加坡相关判例法（特别是关于联权共有财产中生存者取得权性质的最新司法观点），深入分析这一主张在法律逻辑上存在哪些根本性的缺陷或矛盾？这些缺陷如何影响法院对其真实赠与意图的判断？\n\n2.  **核心要件审查与举证责任**：本案的核心争议点之一是2016年的行为是否构成一项有效的生前赠与。请依据新加坡关于有效生前赠与的法律要件：\n    *   (a) 具体阐明本案中需要证明的**主观意图**与**交付**要件分别指什么？\n    *   (b) 结合案情细节（如签名时受让人栏为空白、证书始终由妻子持有、申诉人多次变化的解释等），分析申诉人关于“交付”要件未满足的新上诉论点为何难以获得法院支持？这反映了诉讼中的何种程序性或实体性规则？\n    *   (c) 在本案丈夫向妻子转让财产的情形下，**“增进 presumption”** 如何适用？它对本问题的举证责任分配产生了何种决定性影响？申诉人提供的各种解释为何未能完成其举证责任？\n\n3.  **信托主张的可行性**：申诉人曾主张存在归复信托、推定信托等。假设（仅作为假设分析）法院认定不存在有效的生前赠与，请评估申诉人关于“苏米亚蒂女士以信托形式为其持有金条”这一主张的成立可能性。需特别考虑：在苏米亚蒂女士已取得唯一法律所有权且申诉人已放弃联名法律所有权的情况下，主张其为**实益权益**的“生存者”是否存在法律障碍？请引用相关法律原则进行说明。\n\n**请注意**：回答时，请避免直接复述法院判决理由，而应基于提供的案情事实和法律框架进行独立推理分析。\n\n---\n### 题目评价\n\n1.  **法律认知复杂度**：\n    *   **罪名/案由交叉**：本题并非刑事案件，但涉及民事法律中多个复杂领域的交叉，包括**赠与法**（有效要件的认定）、**信托法**（归复信托、推定信托、Quistclose信托的区分与适用）、**财产法**（联权共有、生存者取得权的法律性质）以及**证据法**（举证责任、证人可信度评估）。要求答题者能够厘清不同法律领域在本案中的适用顺序与相互关系。\n    *   **深度逻辑推理**：题目要求分析申诉人主张中的“根本性缺陷”，这需要答题者理解“法律所有权”与“实益所有权”的分离，并把握“生存者取得权”通常附着于法律所有权而非实益所有权这一关键点（如Koh Lian Chye案所确立）。同时，需要将申诉人“放弃法律所有权却保留实益生存者权”的主张识别为逻辑悖论，从而推断其意图陈述不可信。\n    *   **事实与法律交互**：题目要求将高度细节化的事实（如签名位置、栏目空白、证书持有状态、申诉人多次矛盾的解释）与抽象法律要件（赠与的意图与交付、增进 presumption、禁止反言原则）相结合，进行精细化论证。\n\n2.  **区分度**：\n    *   本题具有高区分度，能有效区分仅能记忆法条和能进行复杂法律适用的模型。\n    *   **表面与实质**：初级分析可能仅关注“是否有赠与意图”这一表面问题。而高级分析必须识别到，申诉人关于“生存者取得权”的主张本身在法律上难以成立，这构成了对其整体可信度的重大打击，是推断其具有完全赠与意图的强有力间接证据。\n    *   **程序与实体交织**：题目第二部分涉及上诉审中提出新论点的限制（与初审诉辩状的一致性要求），以及“增进 presumption”这一转移举证责任的特殊规则。能够妥善处理这些程序性与证据法问题的模型，展现出更全面的法律实务能力。\n    *   **假设性分析**：第三部分要求进行反向假设分析（假设赠与无效），并评估信托主张的可行性，这进一步测试了模型在复杂、多分支法律情景下的推理弹性和深度。\n\n3.  **检索必要性**：\n    *   要高质量地回答本题，**必须进行精准的法律检索**（RAG）。核心检索点包括：\n        *   新加坡关于有效**生前赠与（inter vivos gift）** 的法律要件，特别是“意图”与“交付”的判例法定义（如Toh Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina案）。\n        *   新加坡法下**增进 presumption（presumption of advancement）** 在夫妻之间的适用规则及其对举证责任的影响（如Koh Lian Chye案）。\n        *   新加坡上诉法院近期关于**联权共有（joint tenancy）中生存者取得权（right of survivorship）** 仅作用于法律所有权而非实益所有权的权威判决（Koh Lian Chye案，引用Estate of Yang Chun案）。\n        *   可能还需参考关于**归复信托（resulting trust）** 与**共同意图推定信托（common intention constructive trust）** 成立要件的经典判例（如Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun案），以评估申诉人信托主张的强弱。\n    *   缺乏对这些特定条文和判例的检索，答案将流于泛泛而谈，无法触及本案的核心法律争点，也无法进行有深度的批判性分析。因此，本题能有效检验法律大模型结合外部权威知识进行精准推理的能力。",
  "answer": "### 解题思路\n\n本题是一道综合性极强的民事法律案例分析题，涉及赠与法、信托法、财产法及证据法的交叉适用。解题需遵循“识别争议焦点—提取法律要件—结合案情分析—得出结论”的逻辑路径。\n\n1.  **整体框架把握**：首先，应识别本案的核心法律争议是**2016年签署行为是否构成一项有效的生前赠与**。所有其他主张（如信托）均以此为前提或替代方案。因此，分析应围绕赠与的成立要件展开。\n\n2.  **分问题拆解**：\n    *   **问题1（法律定性分析）**：此问题旨在检验对“生存者取得权”法律性质的深层理解。解题关键在于认识到，申诉人“保留实益生存者权”的主张，与“放弃联名法律所有权”的行为，在现行判例法下存在根本矛盾。这一矛盾不仅削弱其主张的可信度，更间接强化了其具有完全赠与意图的推断。\n    *   **问题2（核心要件审查与举证责任）**：此问题是本案实体审理的核心。需分三步：\n        *   (a) 明确新加坡法下有效生前赠与的两大要件：赠与人主观的赠与意图，以及对赠与标的物的有效交付。\n        *   (b) 结合案情（特别是签名时受让人栏空白、证书始终由妻子持有、申诉人多次矛盾陈述），分析“交付”论点为何在上诉中不被采纳。这涉及诉讼程序中的“禁止反言”或“诉辩一致性”原则，当事人不能在一审承认某一事实后，在上诉中提出与之根本矛盾的新事实主张。\n        *   (c) 分析“增进 presumption”的适用。这是本案举证责任分配的关键。在丈夫向妻子转让财产时，法律首先推定其为赠与（即增进妻子利益）。主张存在信托（即非赠与）的丈夫，负有沉重的举证责任来推翻该推定。\n    *   **问题3（信托主张的可行性）**：此问题是在“假设赠与不成立”的前提下进行的反向分析。关键在于分析，在申诉人已通过签署文件明确放弃其联名法律所有权后，其主张作为“实益权益的生存者”在法律上是否可能。这需要援引关于生存者取得权仅附着于法律所有权的权威判例。\n\n3.  **独立推理要求**：需基于题目提供的案情事实和隐含的法律框架（通过“题目评价”部分提示）进行推理，避免简单照搬判决原文，而是用自己的法律语言组织分析。\n\n### 标准答案\n\n#### 问题1：法律定性分析\n\n申诉人主张其在2016年签署文件时，意图是维持与妻子的“共同实益所有权及生存者取得权”。这一主张在法律逻辑上存在**根本性缺陷**，严重影响其可信度。\n\n**根本缺陷在于混淆了“生存者取得权”的法律属性**。根据新加坡上诉法院在 *Koh Lian Chye* 案（采纳 *Estate of Yang Chun* 案观点）中确立的原则，在联权共有关系中，**生存者取得权是普通法上附着于法律所有权的一项权利，它仅在共有人之间就法律所有权发生作用**。当法律所有权发生转移时，原有的联权共有关系即告终止，附着于其上的生存者取得权也随之消灭。\n\n申诉人主张的矛盾之处在于：\n1.  **行为与主张的悖论**：他一方面承认其签署行为有效转移了其在原始金条证书上的**法律所有权**给妻子（使其妻子获得唯一法律所有权），另一方面却又主张保留基于原先联名法律所有权的**实益生存者取得权**。这相当于主张“在放弃权利基础（联名法律所有权）的同时，保留基于该基础的权利（生存者权）”，这在逻辑上无法自洽。\n2.  **对“实益所有权”概念的误用**：生存者取得权解决的是法律所有权在共有人死亡时的归属问题。在实益所有权层面，共有人之间是通过信托或协议来确定份额。申诉人主张的“实益生存者权”，实质上是说“妻子为双方以信托形式持有，但信托利益在我死后全部归我”。这更接近于一种附条件的信托安排，而非典型的、自动发生的生存者取得权。其使用“生存者取得权”这一术语，模糊了其真实意图，也暴露了其法律主张的混乱。\n\n**对法院判断的影响**：这种逻辑上难以成立的主张，严重削弱了申诉人陈述的可信度。法院有理由认为，一个意图清晰、真实的赠与人，不会提出如此自相矛盾的法律主张。因此，这一缺陷成为推断申诉人**实际上具有完全、无保留的赠与意图**的强有力间接证据。如果他的真实意图是设立信托，他本应更清晰地主张一项信托关系，而非诉诸一个在法律上与其行为相冲突的“生存者权”概念。\n\n#### 问题2：核心要件审查与举证责任\n\n**(a) 有效生前赠与的法律要件**\n根据新加坡判例法（如 *Toh Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina*），一项有效的生前赠与需满足两个核心要件：\n*   **主观意图**：赠与人必须具备将财产所有权（包括法律与实益所有权）无偿、不可撤销地转移给受赠人的真实意思。该意图必须是主观的、确定的。\n*   **交付**：必须完成对“特定赠与标的物”的有效交付。对于金条证书这类代表产权的文件，签署并交付该证书通常即构成对标的物（金条）的象征性交付，从而完成所有权转移。\n\n**(b) 申诉人“交付未完成”论点的缺陷**\n申诉人在上诉中提出，因签名时“受让人”一栏空白，故“特定标的物”未交付，赠与未完成。此论点难以获得支持，原因如下：\n1.  **程序性禁止**：在一审中，申诉人明确承认了法律所有权转移的有效性，其诉状和证据均围绕“妻子以信托形式持有”展开。根据诉讼中的**禁止反言**或**诉辩一致性**原则，当事人不能在上诉阶段提出一个与一审中已承认的基本事实（即有效转移）相悖的全新事实主张，除非获得特别许可。申诉人未寻求此许可，故该新论点程序上不可采。\n2.  **实体上不成立**：即使审查实体内容，该论点也站不住脚。\n    *   “交付”的核心是转移控制权。原始证书始终由妻子苏米亚蒂持有，申诉人签名后将其交还妻子。这一行为已实质地将处分证书（从而处分金条）的权力完全赋予妻子。\n    *   “受让人”栏空白，不影响交付行为的完成。妻子随后凭此已签名的文件成功换发了仅以其个人名义持有的新证书，原始证书被注销。这充分证明了该签署文件本身即是有效的交付工具和所有权转移凭证。\n    *   申诉人多次矛盾的解释（见下文(c)部分）进一步表明，其“交付未完成”的主张只是事后为推翻赠与寻找的借口，而非事实。\n\n**(c) “增进 presumption”的适用与举证责任**\n1.  **适用与效果**：本案是丈夫向妻子转让财产。新加坡法律适用 **“增进 presumption”** ，即法律首先推定该转让是丈夫对妻子的赠与（旨在增进妻子利益），而非为丈夫利益设立的归复信托。这一推定将**举证责任完全转移给了主张存在信托（即非赠与）的一方，即本案的申诉人（丈夫）**。他必须提供充分、可信的证据来证明，在转让时，双方不存在赠与意图，而是存在妻子为其利益持有财产的共识。\n2.  **申诉人未能完成举证责任**：申诉人提供了多种相互矛盾的解释，均未能有效推翻该推定：\n    *   **解释矛盾**：其先后声称签名是为了“确保妻子在其死后获得金条”、“只因妻子要求而签”、“为证明金条是自己的”。这些解释彼此冲突，严重损害其作为证人的可信度。\n    *   **解释不合理**：\n        *   “确保妻子死后获得”与联名共有的生存者取得权事实矛盾，无需多此一举。\n        *   “只因妻子要求”对于一个经验丰富的商人而言难以采信。\n        *   “为证明所有权”与签名处为“交付指示”栏目的性质直接冲突，逻辑不通。\n    *   **行为印证意图**：申诉人在“交付指示”处签名并注明日期，然后将文件交还持有证书的妻子，这一系列行为是赠与意图的强烈外在表现。在“增进 presumption”存在的情况下，申诉人混乱且不可信的辩解，不仅未能完成其沉重的举证责任，反而强化了法院对其存在赠与意图的认定。\n\n#### 问题3：信托主张的可行性\n\n假设法院认定2016年的赠与无效（尽管根据上述分析这不可能），评估申诉人“苏米亚蒂女士以信托形式为其持有金条”的主张，其成立可能性**极低**，核心障碍在于其**“生存者”主张与法律原则冲突**。\n\n1.  **归复信托/推定信托的主张难点**：要主张归复信托或基于共同意图的推定信托，申诉人必须证明在2016年转让发生时，双方存在“妻子仅为丈夫（或双方）利益持有金条，而非为自己绝对所有”的共识。然而：\n    *   申诉人矛盾的解释无法证明任何明确的信托共同意图。\n    *   其签署“交付指示”的行为，强烈指向完全的所有权转移，与设立信托的意图相悖。\n    *   “增进 presumption”进一步加重了他的证明负担。\n\n2.  **“生存者”主张的法律障碍（关键障碍）**：申诉人主张的核心是，其作为实益权益的“生存者”，在妻子死后应获得全部金条。这一主张在法律上存在根本障碍：\n    *   如问题1所述，根据 *Koh Lian Chye* 案，**生存者取得权仅作用于联权共有人的法律所有权，而非实益所有权**。\n    *   2016年的签署行为，已使妻子苏米亚蒂成为金条**唯一的法律所有权人**。原有的、以申诉人和妻子为共有人的**法律所有权上的联权共有关系已因法律所有权的转移而终止**。因此，附着于原法律共有关系的生存者取得权也已消灭。\n    *   既然申诉人已不再是法律共有人，他就不可能基于“生存者取得权”而自动取得任何权益。他若想主张金条的实益权益，必须基于独立的信托、合同或其他法律依据，而非生存者权。\n    *   因此，申诉人关于“成为实益生存者”的主张，混淆了法律所有权与实益所有权的范畴，在妻子已取得唯一法律所有权的前提下，缺乏法律基础。\n\n**结论**：综上所述，即使赠与无效的假设成立，申诉人关于信托的主张也因缺乏可信的共同意图证据而难以成立。而其诉诸“生存者取得权”来主张实益所有权的路径，更因与新加坡判例法确立的“生存者权仅属法律范畴”原则直接冲突，而构成无法逾越的法律障碍。因此，该信托主张的可行性微乎其微。",
